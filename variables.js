// TASK ONE: interptrated vs compiled

// variables are used to store data that can be used throughout the application.
//they can be used to store configuration settings, user preferences, or any other data that needs to be accessed globally.


// in js, we can create variables using the var, "let", and "const" keywords.


// Keywords in programming languages are reserved words that have special meaning in the language.
// they are used to define the structure and behaviour of the code.
//  in Javascript, keywords include 'var', 'let', 'const', 'function', 'if', 'else', 'for', 'while', and many others.





// var was the original way to declare variablrs in js, but it has been replaced by let and const becauseb of scope issues.
var username = "John Doe";


// let is used to declare variaables that can be reassigned later in the code.
let age = 25;


// const is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned later in the code.it is also scoped.
const pi = 3.14;

const role = "distributor";
let darkMode = false;

// let variables can be reassigned, but const cannot be reassigned.
age=31;
pi=3.14159;
